    "In our previous discussion of dynamics of complex machines we introduced the idea of the moment of inertia (I is the usual symbol) that represents the rotational equivalent of mass. In depends both on the mass of the object subjected to a moment (torque) as well as the arrangement of the mass relative to the axis of rotation."

    "\n",
    ">It seems remarkably simple but when we worry about the motion of the physical bar as it rotates it gets a bit more exciting. The moment of inertia of a bar around one end is given by $I = \\frac{1}{3}mL^2$ (we will learn to calculate this shortly). Determine the reaction forces at the pin A as a function of $\\theta$ and specifically when the bar is horizontal. Assume the bar is initially stationary when it is released in the horizontal position. \n",
