Recognize that the information we have about any of the 9 variables (x,y,z,$v_x,v_y,v_z,a_x,a_y,a_z$) might depend on t, v, or s! Each of the three directions is mathematically independent though the specific circumstances of the problem setting may compel particular relationships between any of the variables. \n",

The slope provides a constraint between x and y that is needed to find the point at which the package  hits the slope. This is just a conceptual example.\n",

    "\\alpha = \\frac{d\\omega}{dt} = \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2}$.

    "We also have a well defined relationship between the linear and angular variables. From the definition of angles in radians we can see that $\\Delta s = \\rho \\Delta \\theta$ when a particle is traveling along an arc of whose radius of curvature is $\\rho$. This particular image the red line indicates the path of the particle, the blue arc is the imaginary circle of radius $\\rho$ along which the particle is traveling at the instant shown. In the most general sense $\\rho = \\rho(s)$ which may be different at every point along the path. The author uses $\\phi$ to label the angle instead of $\\theta$.\n",

They could just as easily represent $\\hat{i}$ and $\\hat{j}$. \n",
