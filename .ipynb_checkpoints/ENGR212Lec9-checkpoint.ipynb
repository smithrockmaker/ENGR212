    "I think it's helpful to recognize that we have different ways of describing the same event. It's not that one is better or worse but that they provide different perspectives on some aspect of the problem. Energy is an example of focusing on how forces acting over distances either add or remove this quantity we call energy. In the exact same setting we could consider how those same forces act over some time (which is related to distance) and what that might tell us about the event.\n",

    "Many forces act on objects over short periods of time and we have a very limited understanding of their explicit time dependence. In these cases we can glean at least some information by considering the average force that produces a particular change in momentum. On a language level we call $\\Delta \\bar{p}$ the impulse and the forces which create the impulse are called impulsive forces. In some sense all forces are impulsive but we tend to reserve the description for forces acting over a short time frame.\n",

    "### Application Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "Impulse as a concept is about the net forces on a single object of interest. Momentum concepts are more commonly associated with collisions which sometimes leads to confusion. There are impulsive forces on each individual object in a collision which we can determine **IF** we know the duration of the collision. If you are asked about impulse you will normally need to know something about the time over which the process takes place."

    ">In all kinds of sports there is the 'opportunity' to get hit by the ball/puck/racket used in that sport. In hockey the puck has a mass of 170 g and might be moving as fast as 40 m/s. Using high speed photography the duration of the impact with a facemask is determined to be 0.02 s (representative not universal) and the rebound velocity is 5 m/s. If you are a design engineering working for a sports equiment company what is the average impulsive force that that this data suggests? What design force would this suggest for the facemask? Given that the head has a typical mass of 5 kg what is the acceleration of the head in g's after this impact?\n",

    ">A Newton's Cradle is a 'toy' with multiple pendula (usually 5) that swing in different patterns. In this problem we address the simpler question of two pendula colliding with a given coefficient of restitution. Assume the mass of each ball is 225 g and the string is 15 cm long. If the first ball is released from an angle of $ \\theta = 35^o$ and the coefficient of restitution (e) is 0.9 what is the maximum angle for the struck ball after the collision?\n",
