    "This problem is framed in polar coordinates due to the rotation of the slotted bar with a constraint on the pin that is traveling at constant velocity in $\\hat{j}$ direction. The general focus is to determine the components of the velocity and acceleration in polar coordinates by taking it one term at a time. There are a variety of ways to work through this problem. This is just one....\n",
