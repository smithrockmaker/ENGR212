When the mass is 'entering' the object dm/dt is negative! The $\\bar{v}_{flow}$ term is the magnitude and direction of the flow **RELATIVE** to the object ejecting the mass. This is important because it explains why rocket engines and jet engines generate the same amount of force regardless of how fast the plane or rocket is traveling."

At the same time 750 kg/s of snow is being ejected at an angle of $30^o$ from a point 2.5 m above the road so that it lands 10 m away. Find the resulting forces on the snowplow.\n",
