    "### Rigid Body Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems helpful to separate the motion of rigid bodies into some general claases to help distinguish the tools that are relevant. Starting from the awareness the the motion of a rigid body is the collective motion of all the points which make up the rigid body. How those points move relative to the external world and relative to each other characterize different types of motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pure Translation:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is motion where there is no rotation of the object. Surprisingly this can be a bit confusing in some cases though it sounds simple. Thinking of the many points which make up the rigid body can help clarify this setting. When the description of the both the velocity and acceleration of one point of the object completely describes the motion of EVERY point of the object then it is undergoing pure translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rotation Around Fixed Axis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Put in more everyday language this is an object whose only motion is rotation around an unmoving axis. Expressed more carefully this object has a set of points that are not moving which form an axis. All other points of the object are moving in circles around that axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Planar Motion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Any motion of an object, potentially complex, where some set of point of the object lie in a plane and stay in that plane as it moves. The object itself does not need to be planar so long as it meets this criteria. Most settings we have considered this term fall into this catergory. Notice that both of our previous catagories are also planar.\n"
