    ">This problem looks like an old friend that you can't decide if you like. The bar rotates in the horizontal plane with no friction. The sleeve has a mass of 2 kg and the spring is unstretched when r = 0. The spring constant is 40 N/m. When t = 0 the mass is at r = 0.2m and $v_r = 0$. The angular velocity at this point is $\\omega_0 = 6\\: rad/s$. What is $\\omega$  and $v_r$ when r = 0.25 m? \n",

    ">Interestingly a snowblower/rotary snowplow is an example of mass flows in two ways. There is a mass entering the machine in the 'front' usually and there is a mass ejected from the machine to the side at some angle. Consider a highway snowplow which is moving at 1 m/s such that 750 kg/s of snow enters the impellers of the snowblower. At the same time 750 kg/s of snow is being ejected at an angle of $30^o$ from a point 2.5 m above the road so that it lands 10 m away. Find the resulting forces on the snowplow.\n",

    ">This not a particularly fascinating problem setting but it permits an exploration of a behavior that is common in hydropower settings. The water is entering each object at 40 m/s with a mass flow rate of 30 kg/s. The 'turbine blade' changes the direction of the flow which produces a force on the blade. Much like the snowplow problem above consider the force due to the entering mass flow as well as the exiting mass flow to get the net force on the turnine blade.\n",
