    "In our previous discussion of dynamics of complex machines we introduced the idea of the moment of inertia (I is the usual symbol) that represents the rotational equivalent of mass. In depends both on the mass of the object subjected to a moment (torque) as well as the arrangement of the mass relative to the axis of rotation."

The total moment of inertia of this beam is the moment of inertia for the large rectangle minus the moment of inertia for each of the 'anti-rectangles' around whatever axis you are interested in. Not surprisingly one has to be careful doing this to get the various applications of the parallel axis theorem correct but it is much easier than trying to set up the integral."
