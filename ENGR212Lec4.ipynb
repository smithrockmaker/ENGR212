    "When we learned about Newton's Laws in physics we started by treating every object as a single point. We probably mentioned that, if we were careful, this point should be located at the center of mass. We rarely talked about this consideration after that. Because we will be looking at more complex behavior in this class we need to be explicit about the meaning of the center of mass as well as it's motion relative to that center of mass. \n",

    "#### The Center of Mass:\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually it is just the balance point of the object. In 1D we have a pretty good intuitive sense of how it works. That intuitive sense gets less secure as we move to 2D and 3D. In 1D the balance point can be determined like this\n",

    "$$\\large x_{cm} = \\frac{\\sum_{i} x_i m_i}{\\sum_{i}m_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $x_i\\: m_i$ terms mean that masses further from the balance point have more effect on the location of the center of mass as you would expect. We can extend this exact idea to arbitrary geometries as\n",

    "$$\\large \\bar{r}_{cm} = \\frac{\\sum_{i} m_i\\: \\bar{r}_i}{\\sum_{i}m_i = m_{total}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i} m_i\\: \\bar{r}_i}{m}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take the second derivative with respect to time of all the individual masses the resulting expression is the same as the second derivative of the center of mass of the system. Because of Newton's 3rd Law **AND** our assumption that we are dealing with rigid bodies any forces acting on any point of the rigid body is effectively acting on the center of mass. \n",

    "..where $\\sum\\limits_{i} F_i $ is the sum of all forces acting on each bit of the rigid object. The conceptually important idea here is that center of mass of an object acts as if ALL forces on the rigid object act on an equivent mass located at the center of mass. Even if the object were to twist and spin as a result of the complex forces acting on it the center of mass responds as a simple object subject to $F_{net}$.\n",

    "Here's an example of a situation where you may not be so confident about this statement. Imagine you have a 2x4 lying flat on a sheet of ice and you are going to push it 'sideways' across the ice. Push on the center, at the center of mass, of the 2x4 with some force and it will move across the ice with some initial speed. Push on the end of the 2x4 with the same force and it will rotate as it moves across the ice (because you pushed at a point away from the center of mass) **BUT** how does it move laterally as it rotates? Is it moving faster, slower, or the same as it travels across the ice while rotating?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of us have the expectation that it will move slower which is wrong. **IF** we push with the same force, which is very hard to do as the end swings away from us, the 2x4 will travel across the ice at the same lateral speed as it did when we push on the middle. This is what the statement above asserts and it is correct. \n",
