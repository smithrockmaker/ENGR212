It's not that one is better or worse but that they provide different perspectives on some aspect of the problem. Energy is an example of focusing on how forces acting over distances either add or remove this quantity we call energy. In the exact same setting we could consider how those same forces act over some time (which is related to distance) and what that might tell us about the event.\n",

    ">In all kinds of sports there is the 'opportunity' to get hit by the ball/puck/racket used in that sport. In hockey the puck has a mass of 170 g and might be moving as fast as 40 m/s. Using high speed photography the duration of the impact with a facemask is determined to be 0.02 s (representative not universal) and the rebound velocity is 5 m/s. If you are a design engineering working for a sports equiment company what is the average impulsive force that that this data suggests? What design force would this suggest for the facemask? Given that the head has a typical mass of 5 kg what is the acceleration of the head in g's after this impact?\n",

    "As we noted in physics the two extreme forms of collisions are those where the objects stick together as a single mass after the collision, called **inelastic**, and rigid body collisions where no energy is lost during the collision, called **elastic**. It would be prudent to change our language slightly to recognize these extreme cases as **perfectly inelastic** and **perfectly elastic** to distinguish them from all the intermediate possibilities.\n",

Radioactive decay is actually an example of a perfectly inelastic anti-collision!\n",

    "By careful analysis of the impulsive forces within the collision (along a single axis) we can define a term that relates the velocities of the objects before and after the collision when some energy is lost. The details don't seem to add much value here at this point so I merely quote the result. The symbol for the coefficient of restitution is usually e.\n",

    "**I have found it difficult to keep this expression straight and last version is the most helpful for me**! Depending on the direction of the velocities of each object in your coordinate system you may add or subtract those velocities to get the relative velocity. The coefficient of restitution relates the **magnitude** of the relative velocity AFTER the collision to the **magnitude** of the relative velocity BEFORE the collision. It only applies along any axis where there are forces.\n",
